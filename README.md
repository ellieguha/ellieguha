### Hello everyone!! 👋
I am hoping to share some useful resources for students wanting to push past their current Mathematical knowledge. 

This will centre around recommended topics (such as areas of Calculus or Set Theory), along with some notes, exercises, and useful things like lectures and books! If you want to take advantage of this page, I imagine you might be wanting to get a head start at next year's Maths by looking at A-level material. Or, you might be a young mathematician bored to death with school maths and wanting to get stuck into 'real maths' but not knowing where to start

I will recommend different channels for you based on your mathematical experience. Identify your group based on the following criteria:

##### 🐨 Finished GCSE level maths (or an equivalent qualification)

##### 🐰 Finished GCSE level maths and Additional Mathematics GCSE (or an equivalent qualification)

##### 🐶 Year 11 or below student

##### 🐷 An A-level student taking Maths/Maths and Further Maths hoping for some fun extension material

Please leave comments with feedback and feel free to request some topics or resources!
